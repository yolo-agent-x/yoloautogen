class TerminationCondition(ABC):
    """A stateful condition that determines when a conversation should be terminated.

    A termination condition is a callable that takes a sequence of ChatMessage objects
    since the last time the condition was called, and returns a StopMessage if the
    conversation should be terminated, or None otherwise.
    Once a termination condition has been reached, it must be reset before it can be used again.

    Termination conditions can be combined using the AND and OR operators.

    Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            from autogen_agentchat.teams import MaxTurnsTermination, TextMentionTermination

            # Terminate the conversation after 10 turns or if the text "TERMINATE" is mentioned.
            cond1 = MaxTurnsTermination(10) | TextMentionTermination("TERMINATE")

            # Terminate the conversation after 10 turns and if the text "TERMINATE" is mentioned.
            cond2 = MaxTurnsTermination(10) & TextMentionTermination("TERMINATE")

            ...

            # Reset the termination condition.
            await cond1.reset()
